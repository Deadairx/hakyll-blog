title: About Me
---

- Developer and engineering manager at [URBN][URBN] in Philadelphia
    (My opinions are my own.)
- Fanboy of:
    - my family (really, they're awesome)
    - [soccer][AFC]
    - guitars
    - [board games][BGG]

## Writing

I write about whatever strikes me. The apparent lack of structure may be
a symptom of my being simultaneously a busy professional, and a scatterbrained
father of small children. Whatever the reason,
<abbr title="what you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr>.

Feel free to [get in touch](/contact).

## Colophon

The site is built with [Hakyll][h]â€”a static site generator made with Haskell.
The website source code is available on [GitHub][GH]. The posts are written in
Markdown. The files are served up by [Caddy][caddy], an HTTP/2 server written
in Go.

The snail-shell logo was created with [Squarespace Logo][logo]. It represents
many things to me: a former home, mathematical perfection in nature, and, well,
how slow I can be!

### Attribution

The majority of the site build scripts, templates, and styles were created by
[Danny Su][dannysu]. He runs a very interesting Hakyll blog.

### Why did I choose Hakyll?

- I have a long-standing affinity for the amazing [Pandoc][Pandoc].
- I've been enjoying teaching myself the Haskell programming language.
- Did I mention Pandoc?
